# Cyclegan
This project focuses on a variant of GAN called CycleGAN, used to translate between MRI and CT scans. By leveraging the existing wide array of MRI and CT scan images, a bidirectional transla- tion framework maps images from one DICOM format to another, preserving anatomical details through adversarial training.

Please modify the addresses before running as I've hardcoded them.
In the future, I may streamline the code to automate this step.
