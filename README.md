# Cyclegan
This project focuses on a variant of GAN called CycleGAN, used to translate between MRI and CT scans. By leveraging the existing wide array of MRI and CT scan images, a bidirectional transla- tion framework maps images from one DICOM format to another, preserving anatomical details through adversarial training.
